# Agent Documentation Update Progress

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created comprehensive centralized agent reference guide at `docs/AGENTS.md`
- [x] Updated `engineering-ux.md` with orchestration integration context
- [x] Updated `research-ai.md` with orchestration integration and team coordination
- [x] Updated `meta-summary.md` with orchestration awareness and event handling
- [x] Enhanced `meta-agent.md` with state management and system architecture context
- [x] Updated `engineering-lead.md` with comprehensive orchestration integration
- [x] Updated main team documentation (`ai_docs/TEAM.md`) to reference orchestration system

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Update remaining orchestrator agents (engineering-director, qa-director, devops-manager)
- [ ] Add orchestration context to remaining core engineering agents (engineering-fullstack, engineering-api)
- [ ] Update QA team agents with orchestration integration
- [ ] Update DevOps team agents with orchestration context
- [ ] Update Creative team agents with orchestration awareness
- [ ] Review and ensure consistency across all agent orchestration sections
- [ ] Validate that all agents properly document their event emission/subscription patterns
- [ ] Ensure all team orchestrators have proper delegation and coordination patterns documented

## Key Improvements Made
1. **Centralized Documentation**: Created comprehensive `docs/AGENTS.md` with full agent ecosystem overview
2. **Orchestration Integration**: Added consistent orchestration sections to key agents including:
   - Team role and capacity information
   - State management patterns and code examples
   - Communication protocols and event handling
   - Cross-team coordination points
3. **Team Hierarchy Clarity**: Documented orchestrator roles and team member relationships
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Specified event emission and subscription patterns
5. **State Management**: Provided code examples for orchestration state updates
6. **Cross-Team Coordination**: Documented how agents coordinate across team boundaries

## Documentation Standards Established
- All agents should include "Orchestration Integration" section
- State management code examples in Python format
- Event handling with emit/subscribe patterns clearly specified
- Team role, capacity, and coordination points documented
- Cross-team communication protocols defined
