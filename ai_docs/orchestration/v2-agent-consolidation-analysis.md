2. **engineering-fullstack** - Can spawn specialized helpers
3. **product-manager** - Can coordinate with analysts
4. **product-analyst** - Can spawn research tasks
5. **meta-init-enhancer** - Can spawn configuration tasks

### Pure Workers (42 agents)
Specialized agents that perform specific tasks without delegation capabilities.

### Model Distribution
- **Opus (12 agents)**: Orchestrators and complex reasoning tasks
- **Sonnet (38 agents)**: General purpose workers
- **Haiku (4 agents)**: Simple, high-volume tasks

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Consolidation (Week 1-2)
1. Merge duplicate orchestrators (engineering-director/manager)
2. Consolidate documentation agents
3. Merge SEO specialists
4. Combine script generation agents

### Phase 2: Team Restructuring (Week 3-4)
1. Establish clear orchestrator hierarchy
2. Define coordinator roles and responsibilities
3. Reassign workers to consolidated teams
4. Update Task tool permissions

### Phase 3: Capability Enhancement (Week 5-6)
1. Add cross-functional capabilities to coordinators
2. Enhance orchestrator team management features
3. Implement standardized communication protocols
4. Add monitoring and metrics to all orchestrators

### Phase 4: Migration & Testing (Week 7-8)
1. Create migration scripts for agent replacement
2. Update existing commands and workflows
3. Test consolidated agent performance
4. Document new agent capabilities

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Efficiency Gains
- **45% reduction** in agent count (54 → 30)
- Clearer delegation paths
- Reduced context switching
- Faster task completion

### Cost Optimization
- Fewer Opus model invocations
- Optimized model selection per task
- Reduced token usage through specialization
- Better resource utilization

### Improved Maintainability
- Clearer agent responsibilities
- Reduced code duplication
- Standardized patterns
- Easier onboarding

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Cross-functional coordinators
- Better team collaboration
- Unified quality standards
- Consistent output formats

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Loss of specialization**: Mitigated by maintaining domain expertise in consolidated agents
2. **Orchestration complexity**: Addressed through clear hierarchy and communication protocols
3. **Migration disruption**: Phased approach with backwards compatibility
4. **Performance degradation**: Careful model selection and capability allocation

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain v1 agents during transition
- Implement feature flags for agent selection
- Create compatibility layer for gradual migration
- Monitor performance metrics throughout

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Agent invocation count reduction: Target 30-40%
- Task completion time: Target 20% improvement
- Token usage: Target 25% reduction
- Error rate: Target <5% increase during migration

### Qualitative Metrics
- User satisfaction with consolidated agents
- Developer feedback on maintainability
- System complexity reduction
- Documentation clarity improvement

## Conclusion

The proposed v2 agent consolidation reduces the system from 54 to 30 agents while maintaining all functionality. This 45% reduction improves maintainability, reduces costs, and creates clearer delegation patterns. The phased migration approach ensures minimal disruption while delivering immediate benefits through the elimination of obvious redundancies.

The new hierarchy establishes clear tiers of responsibility:
- **5 Primary Orchestrators** manage teams
- **5 Secondary Coordinators** handle cross-functional concerns
- **20 Specialized Workers** execute specific tasks

This structure aligns with best practices for distributed systems while maintaining the flexibility needed for complex software development workflows.
