## Usage Examples

### Strategic Decision Making
```
User: /decision "Adopt Microservices Architecture" "Should we migrate to microservices?"
Chat: Decision proposed: Adopt Microservices Architecture
      Quorum required: 3 directors
      Notifying all directors...

[engineering-director]: From an engineering perspective, microservices would improve scalability but increase complexity.

[qa-director]: Testing complexity would increase significantly. We'd need investment in integration testing.

User: /vote decision-001 "Approve"
Chat: Vote recorded: Approve (1/3)

[product-director]: /vote decision-001 "Defer"
Chat: Vote recorded: Defer (2/3)
```

### Multi-Agent Discussion
```
User: Should we prioritize performance optimization or new features this sprint?

[product-director]: Customer feedback indicates feature gaps are our main concern.

[engineering-director]: Our current performance metrics show 200ms average response time, which is acceptable.

[qa-director]: I agree with engineering. Performance is stable. Feature testing capacity is available.

User: /consensus
Chat: Emerging consensus: Prioritize new features (75% alignment)
```

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Directors participate with unique perspectives
- **Decision Tracking**: Formal decision proposals with voting and consensus
- **Threaded Discussions**: Maintain context across complex conversations
- **Strategic Alignment**: All decisions checked against goals and resources
- **Real-time Consensus**: Visual indicators of agreement levels
