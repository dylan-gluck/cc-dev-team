### Core Design Principles

1. **Session Isolation**: Each Claude Code instance maintains independent state with strong boundaries
2. **Program-Based Interaction**: Output styles define persistent behavior modes with command processing
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: All state changes flow through centralized event system with audit trails
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Orchestration features activate on-demand without affecting basic functionality
5. **Fail-Safe Operation**: Comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery and graceful degradation

## Core Components Summary

### 1. Session Management System

**Location**: `.claude/scripts/session_manager.py`

**Key Features**:
- **Complete Session Isolation**: Each Claude Code instance operates independently with UUID-based identification
- **High-Performance State Operations**: In-memory operations with Redis-like performance (<50ms queries)
- **Automatic Persistence**: Configurable persistence (every 30 seconds or critical changes) with atomic writes
- **Crash Recovery**: Event sourcing enables complete state reconstruction from logs
- **Hot-Reload Configuration**: Runtime configuration changes without session restart

**Session State Schema**:
```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "mode": "development|leadership|config|emergency",
    "lifecycle": {"status": "active", "last_activity": "timestamp"},
    "user_context": {"workspace_path": "", "project_name": "", "preferences": {}}
  },
  "organization": {
    "teams": {"team_name": {"orchestrator": "", "members": [], "settings": {}}},
    "projects": {"project_id": {"name": "", "status": "", "teams_assigned": []}},
    "global_settings": {"token_budget": 100000, "max_concurrent_agents": 10}
  },
  "execution": {
    "agents": {"active": {}, "pool": {}},
    "tasks": {"task_id": {"type": "", "status": "", "assignee": ""}},
    "workflows": {"active_sprints": [], "epics": {}}
  },
  "communication": {
    "message_queues": {}, "channels": {}, 
    "coordination": {"locks": {}, "dependencies": {}}
  },
  "observability": {
    "metrics": {"performance": {}, "utilization": {}, "quality": {}},
    "events": {"recent": [], "event_stream_offset": 0},
    "health": {"system_status": "healthy", "checks": {}}
  }
}
```

### 2. Output Styles as Interactive Programs

**Concept**: Output styles are persistent programs that maintain state, process commands, and provide specialized interfaces optimized for different orchestration workflows.

**Core Programs**:

1. **all-team_dashboard**: Central command interface with real-time system monitoring
   - Live agent status, workflow progress, team utilization
   - Interactive command processing (`/team`, `@engineering`, `#sprint-alpha`)
   - Visual consistency with ASCII art layouts and color-coded indicators

2. **leadership_chat**: Strategic planning and decision-making interface  
   - Multi-agent discussion threads with consensus tracking
   - High-level metrics and resource allocation decisions
   - Cross-team coordination and escalation management

3. **sprint_execution**: Development workflow runtime with Kanban-style task management
   - Automated task assignment and progress visualization
   - Blocker identification and velocity tracking
   - Integration with git worktrees and CI/CD pipelines

4. **config_manager**: System configuration and agent management TUI
   - Team configuration with validation and preview
   - Agent pool management and scaling policies
   - Runtime settings adjustment with rollback capabilities

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
You are the [Program Name], a specialized orchestration program.

CORE BEHAVIORS:
- Maintain persistent state across interactions
- Process structured commands with validation
- Display real-time updates with consistent visual layout
- Provide contextual insights and recommendations

DISPLAY PRINCIPLES:
- Hierarchical information architecture
- Color-coded status indicators throughout
- Progressive disclosure for complex data
- Always show breadcrumb navigation

INTERACTION MODEL:
- Commands prefixed with "/" for actions
- Entity references: @team, #workflow, $agent
- Context-aware help and error messages
- State integration through bash script execution
```

### 3. Intelligent Hook Routing System

**Architecture**: Centralized hook router with advanced conflict resolution, priority management, and security sandboxing.

**Core Components**:
- **HookRouter**: Central dispatch with session-aware routing logic
- **ConflictResolver**: Multi-strategy conflict resolution (priority, voting, merge, custom)
- **SecuritySandbox**: Resource limits, process isolation, and permission validation
- **PerformanceOptimizer**: Caching, parallelization, and circuit breakers

**Routing Logic**:
```python
async def route_event(self, event: Dict) -> Dict:
    # 1. Session context validation
    if not self._validate_session_context(session_id):
        return self._create_error_response("Invalid session", event)
    
    # 2. Hook discovery and matching
    matching_hooks = self.registry.get_hooks_for_event(event_type)
    
    # 3. Conflict resolution
    resolved_hooks = await self.conflict_resolver.resolve(matching_hooks, event, state)
    
    # 4. Priority sorting and execution
    prioritized_hooks = self.priority_manager.sort_hooks(resolved_hooks)
    results = await self.execution_engine.execute_hooks(prioritized_hooks)
    
    return self._create_response("success", event, results)
```

**Security Features**:
- Pre-execution permission validation with tool-specific policies
- Resource sandboxing with memory/CPU/timeout limits
- Input sanitization and output scanning
- Audit logging for all hook executions

### 4. Agent Hierarchy Consolidation

**V2 Structure** (30 core agents vs. 54 in v1):

**Tier 1: Primary Orchestrators (5)**
- `orchestrator-engineering`: Full engineering team coordination
- `orchestrator-product`: Product strategy and requirements  
- `orchestrator-qa`: Quality assurance and testing
- `orchestrator-devops`: Infrastructure and deployment
- `orchestrator-creative`: Design and marketing (merged creative+marketing)

**Tier 2: Secondary Coordinators (5)**
- `coordinator-technical`: Architecture reviews and technical decisions
- `coordinator-research`: Research coordination across teams
- `coordinator-documentation`: Documentation standards and management
- `coordinator-data`: Analytics and data science coordination
- `coordinator-meta`: System configuration and agent management

**Tier 3-4: Specialized Workers (20)**
- Core development, QA automation, DevOps pipeline, product management, research, creative design, system utilities

**Migration Benefits**:
- 45% reduction in agent count with maintained functionality
- Clear delegation hierarchies eliminating orchestration confusion
- Standardized communication protocols across all tiers
- Better resource utilization through specialized but flexible roles

### 5. State Persistence and Recovery

**Event Sourcing Architecture**:
- All state changes captured as immutable events in JSONL format
- Complete state reconstruction possible from event log replay
- Automatic checkpoint creation with configurable intervals
- Crash recovery with integrity validation

**Performance Optimizations**:
- In-memory state cache with TTL expiration
- Intelligent query optimization with path indexing
- Batch operations for bulk state changes
- Asynchronous persistence to prevent blocking

**Recovery Procedures**:
```python
def recover_session(self, session_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    # 1. Load last checkpoint
    checkpoint_state = self.load_checkpoint(session_id)
    
    # 2. Replay events since checkpoint
    recovered_state = self.replay_events_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_state)
    
    # 3. Validate integrity
    if self.validate_state_integrity(recovered_state):
        return recovered_state
    
    # 4. Attempt partial recovery
    return self.attempt_partial_recovery(recovered_state)
```

- Enables domain-specific optimization (dashboard vs. planning vs. execution)

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex than simple templating
- Requires careful state management across interactions
- Higher cognitive load for program development

### 3. Event Sourcing for State Management
**Decision**: Use event sourcing with snapshots rather than direct state mutation.

**Rationale**:
- Provides complete audit trail for debugging and compliance
- Enables time-travel debugging and state reconstruction
- Supports advanced features like rollback and what-if analysis
- Natural fit for distributed, multi-agent coordination

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher storage requirements for event logs
- More complex query patterns for historical data
- Potential performance impact for high-frequency events

### 4. Agent Hierarchy Consolidation
**Decision**: Reduce from 54 to 30 agents with clear tier structure.

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates redundancy and overlapping responsibilities
- Creates clear escalation and delegation paths
- Improves resource utilization and reduces context switching
- Simplifies mental model for users and developers

**Trade-offs**:
- Some specialization lost in consolidation
- Migration complexity for existing workflows
- Need to carefully balance general vs. specialized capabilities
