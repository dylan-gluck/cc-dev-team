## Consistency Analysis

### ✅ Strong Consistency Areas

#### 1. Core Architecture Alignment
- **Session-based state management** consistently defined across all documents
- **Event-driven architecture** uniformly applied in hook routing, output styles, and state management
- **JSON schema structure** well-aligned between state management and implementation plans
- **Performance targets** consistently referenced (session init <100ms, state query <50ms, etc.)

#### 2. Agent Orchestration Model
- **Three-tier hierarchy** (Orchestrators → Coordinators → Workers) consistently maintained
- **Tool permissions** properly cascaded through agent consolidation analysis
- **Communication patterns** aligned between hook routing and inter-session API
- **State boundaries** properly enforced across all interaction models

#### 3. Output Style Program Architecture
- **Program-based approach** consistently implemented across all three output styles
- **Command processing patterns** standardized across dashboard, leadership, and sprint interfaces
- **State integration points** uniformly designed for real-time updates
- **Visual consistency** maintained through shared layout templates and status indicators

#### 4. Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful degradation** principle applied consistently
- **User feedback mechanisms** standardized across all interfaces
- **Recovery strategies** aligned with system architecture
- **Escalation paths** properly defined through agent hierarchy

### ⚠️ Minor Inconsistencies

#### 1. Performance Metrics Terminology
- **Issue**: Performance monitoring document uses "session_duration_seconds" while implementation plan references "uptime"
- **Impact**: Low - terminology difference only
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on "session_uptime_seconds" for consistency

#### 2. Agent Count References
- **Issue**: Implementation plan mentions "~30 core agents" while consolidation analysis specifies exactly 30
- **Impact**: Low - minor numerical discrepancy
- **Recommendation**: Use "30 core agents" consistently

#### 3. Event Stream Buffer Sizes
- **Issue**: State management specifies 100 recent events, hook routing mentions 1000 events
- **Impact**: Medium - affects memory usage calculations
- **Recommendation**: Align on configurable buffer sizes with 100 default for recent events, 1000 for full event log

#### 4. WebSocket Connection Patterns
- **Issue**: Inter-session API shows WebSocket usage while output styles focus on HTTP polling
- **Impact**: Medium - affects real-time update architecture
- **Recommendation**: Clarify when to use WebSocket vs HTTP polling based on update frequency

## Gap Analysis

### 1. Missing Implementation Details

#### Security Implementation Specifics
- **Gap**: While security model is well-defined, specific encryption algorithms and key management are not detailed
- **Needed**: Specific encryption standards (AES-256, JWT algorithms, key rotation procedures)
- **Priority**: High - required for production deployment

#### Integration Testing Strategy
- **Gap**: No comprehensive integration testing approach across the v2 system
- **Needed**: Test scenarios for session handoffs, state synchronization, and output style transitions
- **Priority**: High - critical for reliability validation

#### Backup and Recovery Procedures
- **Gap**: State persistence covers normal operations but lacks disaster recovery procedures
- **Needed**: Data backup strategies, state reconstruction procedures, emergency protocols
- **Priority**: Medium - important for production resilience

### 2. Incomplete Specifications

#### Cross-Output-Style Navigation
- **Gap**: Navigation between output styles (dashboard→leadership→sprint) not fully specified
- **Needed**: State preservation during transitions, context carrying, breadcrumb management
- **Priority**: Medium - affects user experience consistency

#### Performance Monitoring Integration Points
- **Gap**: How performance monitoring integrates with output styles and real-time updates
- **Needed**: Metric collection from output style programs, dashboard integration, alert routing
- **Priority**: Medium - important for operational visibility

#### Agent Communication Protocol Details
- **Gap**: Specific message formats and routing between consolidated agents
- **Needed**: Message schemas, routing tables, communication patterns for the 30-agent architecture
- **Priority**: Medium - required for agent coordination

### 3. Unaddressed Requirements

#### Multi-User Session Handling
- **Gap**: Architecture assumes single-user sessions but doesn't address collaborative workflows
- **Needed**: Multi-user state synchronization, permission management, conflict resolution
- **Priority**: Low - future enhancement

#### Mobile/Web Interface Considerations
- **Gap**: Architecture focuses on CLI but lacks consideration for other interfaces
- **Needed**: API design for external interfaces, state exposure patterns
- **Priority**: Low - not in current scope

#### Audit and Compliance Features
- **Gap**: Limited audit trail specifications for enterprise requirements
- **Needed**: Comprehensive audit logging, compliance reporting, data retention policies
- **Priority**: Low - enterprise feature

## Conflicts Identified

### 1. Minor Technical Conflicts

#### State Update Frequency
- **Conflict**: Performance monitoring suggests 30-second intervals while output styles target 500ms updates
- **Resolution**: Use adaptive update frequency: 500ms for active UI updates, 30s for background metrics
- **Impact**: Low - affects only update timing

#### Memory Usage Targets
- **Conflict**: Implementation plan targets <500MB per session, state management allows up to 50MB state + caching
- **Resolution**: Clarify that 500MB includes all session overhead, 50MB is core state size
- **Impact**: Low - clarification needed in documentation

### 2. Architecture Alignment Issues

#### Hook vs Output Style Event Handling
- **Conflict**: Hook routing emphasizes external process execution while output styles focus on internal command processing
- **Resolution**: Clarify that hooks handle external integrations, output styles handle user interactions
- **Impact**: Medium - affects implementation approach

#### Session Isolation vs Inter-Session Communication
- **Conflict**: Strong session isolation principle conflicts with inter-session communication requirements
- **Resolution**: Session isolation for state, controlled communication for coordination via shared APIs
- **Impact**: Medium - affects security and architecture boundaries

## Resource and Timeline Analysis

### Implementation Effort Distribution
```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation           - Well specified ✅
