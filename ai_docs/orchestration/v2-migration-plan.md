# V2 Orchestration Migration Plan

## Migration Overview

**Objective**: Seamlessly transition from v1 to v2 orchestration system with zero downtime and minimal risk.

**Key Changes**:
- Unified state management with centralized StateManager
- Event-driven architecture replacing direct agent coupling
- Improved capacity management and resource allocation
- Enhanced team coordination patterns

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (February 3 - March 14, 2025)

## Phase 1 - Preparation (Week 1-2)

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Create v2 staging environment
cp -r orchestration/ orchestration_v2/
git checkout -b orchestration-v2-migration

# Install v2 dependencies
pip install state-manager==2.0.0
pip install event-bus==1.5.0
npm install @orchestration/core@2.0.0
```

### Backup Procedures
1. **State Backup**:
   ```python
   # Daily automated backups
   python scripts/backup_orchestration_state.py --version v1 --output backups/
   ```

2. **Configuration Snapshot**:
   - Export all agent configurations
   - Archive workflow definitions
   - Document custom integrations

### Dependency Validation
- [ ] Verify all agents compatible with v2 event system
- [ ] Test state migration scripts in isolated environment
- [ ] Validate API contracts remain intact
- [ ] Ensure monitoring tools support v2 metrics

## Phase 2 - Parallel Operation (Week 3-4)

### Feature Flag Implementation
```python
# config/feature_flags.py
ORCHESTRATION_FLAGS = {
    "use_v2_orchestration": False,  # Start with v1
    "v2_user_percentage": 0,        # Gradual rollout
    "v2_enabled_teams": [],         # Team-by-team migration
    "fallback_to_v1": True          # Safety net
}
```

### Dual Runtime Setup
```python
# orchestration/runtime_selector.py
def get_orchestration_runtime(user_context):
    if feature_flag("use_v2_orchestration", user_context):
        return V2OrchestrationEngine()
    return V1OrchestrationEngine()
```

### User Opt-in Mechanism
1. **Beta Program**:
   - Internal team testing (Week 3)
   - Power user early access (Week 4)
   - Feedback collection via `/feedback-v2` command

2. **Gradual Rollout**:
   ```
   Day 1-3: 5% random users
   Day 4-7: 25% users + all QA team
   Day 8-14: 50% users + Engineering team
   ```

## Phase 3 - Migration (Week 5-6)

### Data Conversion Scripts

```python
# scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py
def migrate_orchestration_state():
    """Convert v1 state format to v2 structure"""
    v1_state = load_v1_state()
    
    v2_state = {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "teams": convert_team_structure(v1_state),
        "workflows": migrate_workflow_definitions(v1_state),
        "events": extract_event_mappings(v1_state),
        "capacity": calculate_v2_capacity(v1_state)
    }
    
    validate_v2_state(v2_state)
    return v2_state
```

### Agent Consolidation Mapping

| V1 Agents | V2 Team Structure |
|-----------|-------------------|
| backend-engineer, frontend-engineer | engineering-fullstack |
| ui-designer, ux-researcher | engineering-ux |
| test-engineer, qa-specialist | qa-analyst |
| devops-engineer, sre | devops-infrastructure |
| pm, product-owner | product-manager |

### State Migration Procedures

1. **Pre-migration Checklist**:
   - [ ] Full v1 state backup completed
   - [ ] All active workflows completed or paused
   - [ ] User notifications sent
   - [ ] Rollback scripts tested

2. **Migration Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Stop v1 orchestration
   systemctl stop orchestration-v1
   
   # Run migration
   python scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py --validate --backup
   
   # Start v2 orchestration
   systemctl start orchestration-v2
   
   # Verify health
   curl http://localhost:8080/health/v2
   ```

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions
- Error rate > 5% in first hour
- Critical workflow failures
- State corruption detected
- Performance degradation > 20%

### Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Immediate rollback script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Initiating v2 rollback..."

# 1. Stop v2 services
systemctl stop orchestration-v2

# 2. Restore v1 state
python scripts/restore_v1_state.py --latest-backup

# 3. Restart v1 services
systemctl start orchestration-v1

# 4. Verify v1 health
./scripts/verify_v1_health.sh

# 5. Alert team
./scripts/send_rollback_notification.sh
```

### Data Preservation
- Keep v2 state snapshots for analysis
- Maintain audit log of all migration activities
- Preserve user feedback and error reports
- Archive performance metrics for comparison

## Success Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Response time < 200ms (p95)
- [ ] Task delegation latency < 50ms
- [ ] Event processing throughput > 1000/sec
- [ ] Memory usage < 2GB per orchestrator
- [ ] CPU utilization < 40% average

### Feature Parity Checklist
- [ ] All v1 workflows functional in v2
- [ ] Agent communication maintained
- [ ] State persistence working
- [ ] Event routing operational
- [ ] Capacity management active
- [ ] Cross-team coordination functional
- [ ] Emergency procedures tested

### User Acceptance Metrics
- [ ] 95% task completion rate
- [ ] < 1% error rate in production
- [ ] User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- [ ] No critical bug reports in 48 hours
- [ ] Successful processing of 10,000+ tasks

## Post-Migration Actions

1. **Week 7 - Cleanup**:
   - Remove v1 code and dependencies
