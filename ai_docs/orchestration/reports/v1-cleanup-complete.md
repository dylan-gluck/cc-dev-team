## Preservation Notes

- Project-specific configurations in `.claude/settings.json` were maintained
- Non-orchestration hooks and scripts were left untouched

## Next Steps
1. Migrate to V2 UV-based orchestration scripts
2. Update agent definitions for V2 compatibility
3. Implement new session management patterns
