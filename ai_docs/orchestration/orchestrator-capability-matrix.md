        assignment_score = (
            expertise_match(task, agent) * 0.5 +
            capacity_availability(agent) * 0.3 +
            context_continuity(task, agent) * 0.2

        """Standardized escalation matrix across orchestrators"""
        if issue_severity == "critical" and len(affected_teams) > 1:
            # Cross-orchestrator emergency protocol
            return initiate_cross_team_emergency_response(affected_teams)
        elif issue_severity == "high":
            # Single orchestrator with cross-team coordination
            return coordinate_high_priority_resolution(affected_teams)
