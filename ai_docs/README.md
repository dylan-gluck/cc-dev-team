# AI Documentation Hub

This directory serves as the centralized knowledge base for AI-generated documentation and reference materials supporting the agent-workflows development team. The documentation is organized into vendor-specific subdirectories and core orchestration specifications.

## Purpose

The ai_docs/ folder provides:
- **Technical Reference Materials**: Condensed documentation for development tools and frameworks
- **Orchestration Specifications**: Comprehensive specifications for multi-agent system architecture
- **Team Coordination Guidelines**: Documentation for agent roles and responsibilities
- **Tool Inventories**: Complete listings of available tools and capabilities

This documentation is primarily consumed by specialized sub-agents during development tasks, ensuring they have access to current, accurate technical information without requiring live web searches.

## Directory Structure

### Development Workflows
Outlines standardized development processes:
- Sprint initialization and management
- Task delegation and execution patterns
- Code review and quality assurance procedures
- Release management and deployment workflows

## Content Standards

### Technical Accuracy
All documentation is verified against actual code implementations and official vendor documentation. Content is regularly updated to reflect current versions and best practices.

### Information Density
Documentation prioritizes concise, actionable information over comprehensive explanations. Each document provides focused guidance for specific use cases and workflows.

### Practical Examples
Code examples are working implementations that can be executed directly. Examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns and common integration scenarios.

### Structured Format
All documentation follows consistent markdown formatting with:
- Clear section hierarchies and navigation
- Code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Tables for configuration options and parameters
- Links to related documentation and resources

## Usage Patterns

### Agent Consumption
Sub-agents reference this documentation during task execution to:
- Understand available tools and their capabilities
- Follow established coding patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across development workflows
- Access vendor-specific API and configuration details

### Development Team Reference
Human developers use this documentation to:
- Understand the agent orchestration framework
- Configure new agents and workflows
- Debug agent interactions and state management
- Extend the system with new capabilities

### Knowledge Base Maintenance
The engineering-docs agent maintains this documentation by:
- Fetching latest vendor documentation using web scraping tools
- Condensing comprehensive documentation into actionable references
- Validating examples against current implementations
- Updating specifications as the system evolves

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Content Updates
- Vendor documentation is refreshed when new versions are released
- Orchestration specifications are updated as the system architecture evolves
- Agent definitions are modified when roles or capabilities change
- Tool inventories are maintained as new tools are integrated

### Quality Assurance
- All code examples are tested for correctness and functionality
- Documentation is validated against current system implementations
- Cross-references between documents are verified and maintained
- Outdated or deprecated information is promptly removed

### Version Control
- Documentation changes are tracked through git commits
- Major specification updates include migration guides
- Breaking changes are clearly documented with impact assessments
- Historical versions are preserved for reference and rollback

## Integration Points

### State Management System
Documentation references the orchestration state management system for:
- Agent status tracking and coordination
- Task dependency management and execution
- Sprint progress monitoring and reporting
- Inter-agent communication and messaging

### Hook System
Documentation is integrated with Claude Code hooks for:
- Automatic tool inventory updates
- Agent configuration validation
- Workflow state synchronization
- Event-driven documentation updates

### Command System
Custom slash commands reference this documentation for:
- Agent spawning and configuration
- Sprint management and coordination
- Development workflow automation
- System monitoring and observability

## Contributing

### New Documentation
When adding new documentation:
1. Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions
2. Include metadata headers with source URLs and fetch dates
3. Provide practical examples and usage patterns
4. Maintain consistency with existing documentation styles

### Updates and Corrections
When updating existing documentation:
1. Verify changes against current implementations
2. Update related cross-references and dependencies
3. Test all code examples for correctness
4. Document breaking changes and migration paths

### Quality Standards
All documentation must meet these standards:
- Technical accuracy verified against source implementations
- Clear, concise writing focused on actionable information
- Comprehensive examples demonstrating real-world usage
- Consistent formatting and structure throughout
