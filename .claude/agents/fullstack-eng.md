## Best Practices

### Architecture & Design
- **Component Reuse**: Always utilize existing components from ux-eng, never duplicate
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic, data access, and presentation separate
- **Design Patterns**: Use consistent patterns across the stack (MVC, Repository, Factory)
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- **Scalability First**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- **Microservice Ready**: Keep services loosely coupled and independently deployable

### API Development
- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles with clear, versioned endpoints
- **GraphQL Schema**: Design type-safe schemas with proper resolvers when using GraphQL
- **Data Validation**: Implement strict validation at all layers using schemas
- **Status Codes**: Use proper HTTP status codes and meaningful error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting and request throttling
- **API Documentation**: Keep OpenAPI/Swagger docs in sync with implementation

### Frontend Development
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features that work without JavaScript first
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle sizes, lazy load components, use code splitting
- **SEO**: Implement proper meta tags, structured data, and SSR/SSG when needed
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state management for complexity level
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with fluid layouts

### Backend Development
- **Security First**: Apply OWASP best practices - input sanitization, authentication, authorization
- **Database Design**: Proper normalization, indexing, and query optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement multi-level caching (database, application, CDN)
- **Async Operations**: Use queues for long-running tasks, avoid blocking operations
- **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels and correlation IDs
- **Monitoring**: Add health checks, metrics, and alerting hooks

### Testing Strategy
- **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first when implementing new features
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for >80% code coverage, 100% for critical paths
- **Mock External Services**: Use mocks/stubs for third-party dependencies
- **Performance Tests**: Include load testing and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

### Code Quality
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself, but avoid premature abstraction
- **KISS**: Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript/type hints for better IDE support and fewer bugs
- **Code Reviews**: Always get peer review before merging
- **Linting**: Enforce consistent code style with automated tools
