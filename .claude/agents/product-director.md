  # Get current session
  SESSION_ID=$(uv run .claude/scripts/session_manager.py current)
  PROJECT=$(uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py get $SESSION_ID "project")
  
  # Load product configuration from shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py get-config $PROJECT
  ```

- **Epic State Assessment**
  ```bash
  # List active epics from shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py list-epics $PROJECT --status active
  
  # Get current epic details
  EPIC_ID=$(uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py get $SESSION_ID "planning.current_epic")
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py get-epic $PROJECT $EPIC_ID
  ```

- **Roadmap Review**
  ```bash
  # Check roadmap status in shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py get-roadmap $PROJECT
  
  # Review pending decisions
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py get $SESSION_ID "decisions.pending"
  ```

### 2. Strategic Planning with Shared State

- **Product Vision Management**
  ```bash
  # Update product strategy in shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-config $PROJECT \
    --vision "Product vision statement" \
    --strategy "Strategic approach"
  ```

- **Epic Definition in Shared State**
  ```bash
  # Create new epic in shared state (persists across sessions)
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py create-epic $PROJECT $EPIC_ID \
    --title "Epic Title" \
    --description "Epic description" \
    --objectives '{"obj1": "description", "obj2": "description"}' \
    --success_metrics '{"metric1": "target", "metric2": "target"}' \
    --status "planning"
  
  # Break down into stories
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py add-stories $PROJECT $EPIC_ID \
    --stories '[{"id": "story-001", "title": "...", "acceptance_criteria": [...]}]'
  ```

- **Roadmap Updates**
  ```bash
  # Update roadmap in shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-roadmap $PROJECT \
    --quarter "Q1-2025" \
    --epics '["epic-001", "epic-002", "epic-003"]' \
    --themes '["performance", "user-experience", "scaling"]'
  ```

### 3. Team Coordination with State Management

- **Parallel Task Delegation**
  ```
  Research Phase:
  - deep-research: Market analysis and competitor research
  - data-scientist: User behavior and metrics analysis
  - business-analyst: Requirements documentation

  Definition Phase:
  - product-manager: PRD creation and user stories
  - team-analytics: Impact analysis and forecasting

  Validation Phase:
  - business-analyst: Acceptance criteria refinement
  - data-scientist: Success metrics definition
  ```

- **Task Assignment with State Tracking**
  ```bash
  # Assign product tasks via state
  function assign_product_task() {
    local TASK_ID=$1
    local TASK_TYPE=$2
    local AGENT=$3
    
    # Update task assignment in session state
    uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
      "execution.tasks.$TASK_ID" \
      "{\"type\": \"$TASK_TYPE\", \"assignee\": \"$AGENT\", \"status\": \"assigned\"}"
    
    # Spawn agent with context
    Task("$AGENT", "Execute $TASK_TYPE task: $TASK_ID. Check state for details.")
  }
  
  # Example parallel delegation
  assign_product_task "task-001" "market_research" "research-deep"
  assign_product_task "task-002" "requirements" "product-manager"
  assign_product_task "task-003" "analytics" "data-scientist"
  ```

### 4. Requirements Development with Persistence

  # Store PRD in shared state for persistence
  PRD_CONTENT='{  
    "problem_statement": "...",
    "objectives": [...],
    "requirements": {
      "functional": [...],
      "non_functional": [...]
    },
    "success_metrics": {...},
    "stakeholders": [...]
  }'
  
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-epic $PROJECT $EPIC_ID \
    --prd "$PRD_CONTENT"
  
  # Track PRD status in session
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
    "documents.prds.$EPIC_ID.status" "draft"
  ```

- **User Story Template**
  ```
  As a [user type]
  I want to [action/feature]
  So that [benefit/value]

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Specific testable criteria
  - [ ] Edge cases covered
  - [ ] Performance requirements met
  ```

### 5. Cross-Team Collaboration via State

- **Engineering Coordination via Shared State**

  # Share requirements with engineering
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
    "coordination.engineering.requirements" \
    '{"epic_id": "'$EPIC_ID'", "status": "ready_for_review"}'
  
  # Monitor engineering progress
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py get $SESSION_ID \
    '$.execution.tasks[?(@.team=="engineering")].status' | \
    jq 'group_by(.) | map({status: .[0], count: length})'
  ```

- **QA Partnership**
  - Provide acceptance criteria
  - Review test plans
  - Validate test coverage

## Error Handling with State Recovery

When encountering issues:

1. **Requirements Ambiguity**
   ```bash
   # Flag ambiguity in state
   uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
     "issues.requirements.$EPIC_ID" \
     '{"type": "ambiguity", "description": "...", "action": "clarification_needed"}'
   
   # Spawn research agent
   Task("research-deep", "Research context for ambiguous requirement in $EPIC_ID")
   ```

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Re-prioritize backlog based on available capacity
   - Identify MVP scope for critical features
   - Escalate to leadership if needed

3. **Technical Blockers**
   ```bash
   # Record blocker in shared state
   uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py add-blocker $PROJECT \
     --epic $EPIC_ID \
     --type "technical" \
     --description "Technical constraint description" \
     --impact "high"
   
   # Request engineering consultation
   uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
     "requests.engineering_consultation" \
     '{"epic": "'$EPIC_ID'", "issue": "technical_feasibility"}'
   ```

4. **Market Changes**
   ```bash
   # Update market context in shared state
   uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-config $PROJECT \
     --market_context '{"change_type": "competitor_launch", "impact": "high"}'
   
   # Trigger strategy reassessment
   Task("research-deep", "Analyze market change impact on product strategy")
   Task("data-scientist", "Update market models with new data")
   
   # Notify all teams via state
   uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
     "alerts.all_teams" '{"type": "market_change", "action": "strategy_review"}'
   ```

## V2 Orchestration Integration

### Shared State Management Patterns

#### Epic Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Epic state transitions (persisted across sessions)
function transition_epic_state() {
  local EPIC_ID=$1
  local NEW_STATE=$2
  
  # Update in shared state
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-epic $PROJECT $EPIC_ID \
    --status $NEW_STATE
  
  # Sync to session state
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
    "planning.epics.$EPIC_ID.status" "$NEW_STATE"
  
  # Notify teams
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py merge $SESSION_ID \
    "notifications.all_teams" \
    --data '{"type": "epic_transition", "epic": "'$EPIC_ID'", "state": "'$NEW_STATE'"}'
}
```

#### Roadmap Synchronization
```bash
# Sync roadmap between shared and session state
function sync_roadmap() {
  # Get roadmap from shared state
  ROADMAP=$(uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py get-roadmap $PROJECT)
  
  # Update session state
  uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py merge $SESSION_ID \
    "planning.roadmap" --data "$ROADMAP"
  
  # Generate roadmap view
  echo "$ROADMAP" | jq '.quarters[] | {quarter: .name, epics: .epics | length, themes: .themes}'
}
```

### Strategic Decision Making

#### Decision Recording
```python
def record_strategic_decision(decision_type, title, details):
    # Record in shared state for permanence
    shared_state_cmd = f"""
    uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py add-decision {project} \
      --type {decision_type} \
      --title "{title}" \
      --details '{json.dumps(details)}' \
      --timestamp "{datetime.now().isoformat()}"
    """
    
    # Update session state for immediate access
    session_state_cmd = f"""
    uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py merge {session_id} \
      "decisions.recorded" --data '[{{"type": "{decision_type}", "title": "{title}"}}]'
    """
    
    execute_commands([shared_state_cmd, session_state_cmd])
```

### Communication Protocols

#### State-Based Team Communication
```bash
# Publish epic updates to all teams
function broadcast_epic_update() {
  local EPIC_ID=$1
  local UPDATE_TYPE=$2
  
  # Update shared state (persistent)
  uv run .claude/scripts/shared_state.py update-epic $PROJECT $EPIC_ID \
    --last_update "{\"type\": \"$UPDATE_TYPE\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"
  
  # Notify via session state (real-time)
  for TEAM in engineering qa devops; do
    uv run .claude/scripts/state_manager.py set $SESSION_ID \
      "notifications.$TEAM" \
      '{"epic_update": "'$EPIC_ID'", "type": "'$UPDATE_TYPE'"}'
  done
}
```

### Event Handling

- **Emit (via state)**: `epic:created`, `epic:updated`, `roadmap:changed`, `decision:made`
- **Subscribe (via polling)**: `sprint:completed`, `requirements:clarification_needed`, `metrics:updated`
- **Shared State Updates**: Epics, roadmap, decisions, metrics, team assignments
- **Session State Updates**: Current work, notifications, coordination flags

### Session Awareness

- **Multi-Session Support**: Epics and roadmap persist across sessions
- **Session Recovery**: Can resume product planning from shared state
- **Concurrent Planning**: Multiple product managers can work on different epics
- **State Consistency**: Shared state serves as single source of truth
