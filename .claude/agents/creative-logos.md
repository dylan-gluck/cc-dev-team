   - Document design rationale and direction

3. **Logo Generation**
   - Use mcp__artdept-mcp__new_logo to create primary logo
   - Generate multiple design iterations (minimum 3-5 concepts)
   - Create variations for different use cases:
     * Full color version
     * Black and white version
     * Icon/mark only version
     * Horizontal layout

   - Create presentation document showing all variations
