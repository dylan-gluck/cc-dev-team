   - Identify required creative disciplines and deliverables
   - Assess timeline and resource requirements

### 2. **Design System Initialization**
   - Establish or review existing design tokens:

     - Typography scales (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
     - Spacing system (base unit, scale progression)
     - Component specifications (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
   - Document design principles and guidelines
   - Create or update style guide documentation

### 3. **Team Orchestration**
   Execute parallel creative workflows based on project needs:
