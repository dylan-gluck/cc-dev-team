## Technical Specification Creation

Create a comprehensive technical specification for: $ARGUMENTS

### Workflow

Use the tech-lead agent to:

1. **Review Requirements**
   - Analyze business requirements from business-analyst
   - Review technical documentation from doc-expert
   - Understand existing system architecture

2. **Design Architecture**
   - Define system components and interactions
   - Create data models and schemas
   - Design API contracts
   - Plan service boundaries

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Break down into technical tasks
   - Define work sequence
   - Identify dependencies
   - Estimate effort

4. **Define Standards**
   - Specify coding standards
   - Define testing requirements
   - Set performance benchmarks
   - Document security requirements

### Deliverables
- Technical specification document
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation
- Data model definitions
- Implementation roadmap
- Test strategy
- Risk assessment

The specification should be detailed enough for any engineer to implement the feature correctly.
