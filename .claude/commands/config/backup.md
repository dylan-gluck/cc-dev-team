# Configuration Backup Management

Create, restore, and manage configuration backups for the orchestration system.

## Context
- Configuration directory: .claude/orchestration/
- Backup directory: .claude/orchestration/.backups/
- Current backups: !`ls -la .claude/orchestration/.backups/ 2>/dev/null | tail -n +2 | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} backups found"`
- Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Task

Manage configuration backups based on the action specified:

### If "create" or no action:
1. **Create New Backup**
   - Generate timestamp: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
   - Create backup name: backup-[timestamp] or use provided name
   - Create backup directory: `.claude/orchestration/.backups/[backup-name]/`
   - Copy all JSON files from orchestration directory
   - Create manifest file with:
     - Backup timestamp
     - File checksums
     - Configuration versions
     - Reason/description (if provided)
   - Compress if over 1MB

2. **Backup Validation**
   - Verify all files copied successfully
   - Check file integrity
   - Record backup in history log

### If "restore" with backup-name:
1. **Pre-Restore Checks**
   - Verify backup exists
   - Check backup integrity
   - Create safety backup of current state
   - Show differences between current and backup

2. **Restore Process**
   - Confirm restore action
   - Copy files from backup to orchestration directory
   - Validate restored configurations
   - Update state files
   - Log restore operation

3. **Post-Restore**
   - Run validation on restored configs
   - Report any compatibility issues
   - Offer rollback if problems detected

### If "list":
1. **Display Available Backups**
   Show table with:
   - Backup name
   - Creation date/time
   - Size
   - Files included
   - Description/reason
   - Configuration version

2. **Backup Details**
   For each backup show:
   - Age (e.g., "2 days ago")
   - Restore compatibility
   - Notable differences from current

### If "clean":
1. **Cleanup Old Backups**
   - Keep last 10 backups by default
   - Keep all backups from last 7 days
   - Keep weekly backups for last month
   - Keep monthly backups for last year
   - Show what will be deleted
   - Confirm before deletion

### Additional Features:

1. **Backup Comparison**
   If two backup names provided:
   - Show diff between backups
   - Highlight configuration changes
   - Display migration path

2. **Auto-Backup Triggers**
   Create automatic backups before:
   - Major configuration changes
   - Version upgrades
   - Bulk modifications

3. **Backup Export/Import**
   - Export backup as tar.gz
   - Import external backup
   - Validate imported configurations

## Expected Output
