## Parallel Feature Development

Implement feature using parallel agent execution: $ARGUMENTS

### Orchestration Strategy

Run multiple agents in parallel for maximum efficiency:

### Phase 1: Parallel Development
Launch simultaneously:

**UX-ENG Agent:**
- Build UI components and templates
- Create responsive layouts
- Implement mock data structures
- Test across all device sizes
- Document component APIs

**FULLSTACK-ENG Agent:**  
- Build backend APIs
- Implement data models
- Create business logic
- Write API tests
- Document endpoints

**DOC-EXPERT Agent:**
- Fetch any needed technical documentation
- Update project documentation
- Create integration guides

### Phase 2: Integration & Review
After parallel work completes:

**FULLSTACK-ENG Agent:**
- Integrate UI components with backend
- Connect APIs to frontend
- Implement state management
- Add E2E tests
- Ensure all tests pass

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
**TECH-LEAD Agent:**
- Review all code changes
- Verify consistency across workstreams
- Check API contracts match
- Validate security and performance
- Provide approval or feedback

### Benefits of Parallel Execution
- Reduced development time by 40-60%
- Independent component development
- Early identification of integration issues
- Better resource utilization
- Consistent quality across workstreams

### Success Criteria
- All agents complete their tasks successfully
- Integration tests pass
- Code review approved by tech-lead
- Documentation complete
- Feature works end-to-end

This parallel approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining quality through the tech-lead review gate.
