# Generate Tools Documentation

Generate a comprehensive markdown documentation of all available tools from your system prompt and save it to `ai_docs/ALL_TOOLS.md`.

The documentation should:
1. Use clean markdown formatting with proper headers and code blocks
2. Group tools by category (Core, File System, Search, Shell, Web, Task Management, MCP Services, etc.)
3. Display each tool with TypeScript function signature format
4. Include a brief description of each tool's purpose
5. Save the complete documentation to `ai_docs/ALL_TOOLS.md`

After generating, confirm that the file has been updated successfully.
