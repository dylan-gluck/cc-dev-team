## Architecture Design

Design the architecture for: $ARGUMENTS

### Design Process

Use the tech-lead agent with support from business-analyst:

1. **System Architecture**
   - Define high-level architecture
   - Identify system components
   - Design service boundaries
   - Plan communication patterns
   - Define deployment topology

2. **Data Architecture**
   - Design data models
   - Define database schemas
   - Plan data flow
   - Design caching strategy
   - Define data retention policies

3. **API Architecture**
   - Design RESTful endpoints
   - Define request/response schemas
   - Plan versioning strategy
   - Design error handling
   - Define rate limiting

4. **Security Architecture**
   - Design authentication flow
   - Plan authorization model
   - Define encryption requirements
   - Design audit logging
   - Plan compliance measures

5. **Integration Architecture**
   - Identify external systems
   - Design integration patterns
   - Define data transformation
   - Plan error recovery
   - Design monitoring approach

### Deliverables

#### Architecture Document
- System overview diagram
- Component architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Deployment architecture

#### Data Models
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Database schemas
- Data dictionary
- Migration strategy

#### API Specification
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- Endpoint documentation
- Authentication flows
- Error code catalog

#### Security Design
- Threat model
- Security controls
- Compliance mapping
- Audit requirements

### Quality Criteria
- Scalability considered
- Security by design
- Performance optimized
- Maintainability focus
- Clear documentation

The architecture should support both current requirements and future growth.
