## Full Team Development Workflow

Execute complete development cycle for: $ARGUMENTS

### ðŸš€ Team Orchestration Strategy

This command orchestrates all team agents through the complete development lifecycle, maximizing parallel execution for efficiency.

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Parallel)
Launch three agents simultaneously:

**BUSINESS-ANALYST**
- Analyze market and competitors
- Document business requirements  
- Create user stories
- Identify risks and opportunities

**AI-RESEARCH**
- Research latest technical solutions
- Find relevant frameworks and patterns
- Gather performance benchmarks
- Identify best practices

**DOC-EXPERT**
- Fetch vendor documentation
- Create condensed reference guides
- Store in ai_docs/ folder
- Update technical knowledge base

### Phase 2: Planning & Architecture
**TECH-LEAD** (with input from Phase 1 agents)
- Create technical specification
- Design system architecture
- Define API contracts
- Plan implementation roadmap
- Set quality standards

### Phase 3: Parallel Implementation
Launch two agents simultaneously:

**UX-ENG**
- Build UI component library
- Create responsive templates
- Implement design system
- Test across all devices
- Document components

**FULLSTACK-ENG** 
- Build backend APIs
- Implement data models
- Create business logic
- Write API tests
- Document endpoints

### Phase 4: Integration
**FULLSTACK-ENG** (continues from Phase 3)
- Integrate UI with backend
- Connect APIs to frontend
- Implement state management
- Add E2E tests
- Ensure all tests pass

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
**TECH-LEAD** (final review)
- Review all code changes
- Verify cross-agent consistency
- Validate security and performance
- Check documentation completeness
- Provide approval or feedback

### Phase 6: Completion
**WORK-COMPLETION-SUMMARY** (if configured)
- Generate audio summary
- Highlight completed work
- Suggest next steps

### ðŸ“Š Efficiency Metrics

This orchestrated approach typically achieves:
- 50-70% time reduction vs sequential development
- Better code consistency through specialized agents
- Higher quality through dedicated review
- Comprehensive documentation coverage
- Reduced context switching

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

The workflow is complete when:
- [ ] All research documented
- [ ] Technical specification approved
- [ ] UI components built and tested
- [ ] Backend APIs implemented
- [ ] Integration complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation complete

### ðŸ’¡ Orchestration Tips

1. **Parallel Execution**: Always run independent agents in parallel
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Ensure each agent knows its inputs/outputs
3. **Iteration Ready**: Be prepared for feedback loops
4. **Documentation First**: Each agent documents as they work
5. **Quality Gates**: Tech-lead approval before completion

### ðŸ”„ Feedback Loop

If tech-lead identifies issues:
1. Specific agents re-engaged for fixes
2. Targeted corrections made
3. Re-review conducted
4. Process repeats until approval

This team-based approach ensures high-quality delivery through specialized expertise and parallel execution.
